# TimeLapse
<p>Simple app that allows you to create time lapse movies.</p>
<p>I have a ton of old, mostly useless, Android phones laying around. I realized that most of them have pretty decent cameras and could be used to create some amazing time lapse videos.</p>
<b>Version 1.0</b></br>
<p>The intial release will allow you to set the length of the video and how many frames a second to capture.</p>
<p><b>Future Features</b></p>
<p>
  - Support frame rates of < 1fps</br>
  - Upload video file to Dropbox or other cloud storage</br>
  - Auto start and stop based on sunrise/sunset</br>
  - Filters / Camera Settings</br>
  - GPS information</br>
  - Low battery detection, save video before battery dies</br>
